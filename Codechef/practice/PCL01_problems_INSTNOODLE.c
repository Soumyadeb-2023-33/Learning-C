// Chef and Instant Noodles
// Chef has invented 1-minute Instant Noodles. As the name suggests, each packet takes exactly 1 minute to cook.

// X stoves and only 1 packet can be cooked in a single stove at any minute.

// How many customers can Chef serve in 
// Y minutes if each customer orders exactly 
// 1
// 1 packet of noodles?

// Input Format
// The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers 
// X and 
// Y â€” the number of stoves and the number of minutes, respectively.

// Output Format
// Print a single integer, the maximum number of customers Chef can serve in Y minutes
